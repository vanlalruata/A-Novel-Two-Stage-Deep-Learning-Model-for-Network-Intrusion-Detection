# Abstract
Machine learning and deep learning techniques are widely used to assess intrusion detection systems (IDS) capable of rapidly and automatically recognizing and classifying cyber-attacks on networks and hosts. However, when destructive attacks are becoming more extensive, more challenges develop, needing a comprehensive response. Numerous intrusion detection datasets are publicly accessible for further analysis by the cybersecurity research community. However, no previous research has examined the performance of the proposed model on a variety of publicly accessible datasets in detail. Due to the dynamic nature of the attack and its rapidly changing attack techniques, the publicly accessible intrusion datasets must be updated and benchmarked regularly. The deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are examined in this article as types of deep learning models for developing a flexible and effective IDS capable of detecting and comparing them with the proposed model in detecting cyber-attacks. The constant development of network behavior and the fast growth of attacks need the development of IDS and the evaluation of many datasets produced over time through static and dynamic methods. This kind of research enables the identification of the most efficient algorithm for identifying future cyber-attacks. We proposed a novel two-stage deep learning technique hybridizing Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Auto-Encoders (AE) for detecting attacks. The CICIDS2017 and CSE-CICDIS2018 datasets are used to determine the optimum network parameters for the proposed LSTM-AE. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model works well and is applicable for detecting attacks in modern scenarios.
